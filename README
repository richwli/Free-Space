The file is working fine on my own machine so hopefully nothing got messed up during submission onto github. Testing this on
my own machine it appears that everything is fine after downloading from github, apart from having to install all of the pods
from cmd following download (which I think is hopefully normal). However if any issues arise running this, please let me know
and I will share a full zipped file from my local machine if need be.
